# UFOs Analysis

## Overview
  We would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

# Summary
There are a couple of opportunities to the webpage and possible recommendations that could be suitable to develop and add.

### Opportunities
It is helpful that you can filter through the data, but it would be helpful if the search filter boxes would include a dropdown so that users can easily select the data contained within those fields to better utilize. 

#### Recommendations
If the searches can be filtered by the duration of the UFO sighting by grouping the time entries in bins, 0 – 30 seconds, 30 seconds – 1 minute, 1 minute – 2 minutes, 2 minutes – 5 minutes, 5 minutues or more, it would offer the user a better experience.

Although the dataset contains a snapshot of UFO sightings in 2010, it would be helpful- to capture real time data, so that the dataset can feel more complete and broad.
